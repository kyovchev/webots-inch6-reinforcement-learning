# Reinforcement Learning with DDPG Algorithm for INCH6 Robot in Webots

This repository apply the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to train INCH6 robot to reach a specific target.

The original implementation of the algorithm is taken from the [official examples of the deepworlds framework](https://github.com/aidudezzz/deepworlds).

The code is applied to the simulated planar redundant 3D printed robot INCH6.
